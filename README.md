# New York Oil Spill Data: Dimensional Database Design and Analysis

## Part I: ER-Diagram and DB Schema

### Overview
This project involves the creation of preliminary Entity Relationship (ER) diagrams and relational database (DB) schemas for a crime database based on the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS). The provided datasets are stored in multiple CSV files contained within the "California_Crime_2021_DB.zip" file. Additionally, a data dictionary (NIBRS_DataDictionary_highlighted.pdf) is provided for reference.

### Steps Taken
1. **Entity Relationship (ER) Diagram:**
   - Utilized the provided datasets and data dictionary to identify entities, attributes, keys, and relationships.
   - Created an ER diagram using any suitable tool.
   - Each entity is uniquely named, with listed fields representing the entity.
   - Key fields are underlined.
   - Field types (atomic, multivalued, composite, derived) are indicated using specific shapes.

2. **Relational DB Schema:**
   - Based on the ER diagram, developed a relational DB schema.
   - Established relationships among all entities, considering cardinalities (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many).
   
3. **Data File Evaluation:**
   - Provided a general opinion on the organization and tidiness of the provided data files.
   - Offered suggestions for improving the design of the data files, if necessary.


## Part II: DB-Design

### Jupyter Notebook
- Contains solutions to the following problems:
  1. Creating Database Objects
  2. Constructing Database - Bulk Data Loading
  3. Checking Data
  4. Basic Data Analysis
- Each step of the process is documented in a reproducible manner, including downloads and file changes.
- Assumptions are clearly stated, and key decisions are explained in markdown cells.
